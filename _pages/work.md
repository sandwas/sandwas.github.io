* Image caption generation algorithm based on attention mechanism
  *Nov.2019-Now
  *The attention mechanism can quickly capture the information that needs to be focused on in the picture, thus improving the accuracy of subtitles.
  *We are committed to proposing a more complete attentional mechanism
 
 * TF-Attention-Net: An Neural Network for Singing Voice Separation
   *Aug. 2019 - Oct. 2019
   *Working with the researcher from Tencent Inc., I proposed an end-to-end neural network based on
self-attention layer, which focuses on the singing voice separation task. It works on spectrogram
domain, which can separate songs into accompaniments and vocals;
   *Compared with the baselines, the evaluation metric of our model is greatly improved while the
number of model parameters is significantly reduced.
