* I am currently an undergraduate student in School of Computer Science and Technology, [Tiangong University](<http://www.tjpu.edu.cn/>)- (Elite Class of Artificial Intelligence).  I am also a machine learning enthusiast and hope to study NLP related content in the future.
* My research interests are in the general area of machine learning, in particular deep learning, computer vision and the combination of NLP.
* I will graduate from [Tiangong University](<http://www.tjpu.edu.cn/>) this June.
* In my spare time, I like to read some latest papers and share related technologies, including machine learning, computer vision and so on.
